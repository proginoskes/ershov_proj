Dear Professor Ershov!

I recently received your letter from December 22, in which you tell of the possibility of your visit to us in the 2nd quarter of 1970.

I wanted to refer you to to a letter dated February 5, 1969 addressed to Academician M.V. Keldish. In that letter, I extended our invitation for you to come to Stanford University for any period of 1969. I wanted to emphasize to you that this invitation remains valid for any period of 1970 without any change in the duration of the visit. We would be very happy to have you at Stanford University in the 2nd quarter of 1970. It would be best for us if you could come from the very beginning of the quarter, because out Spring Quarter starts March 31. If, however. this is not possible, we will be pleased to welcome you whenever you arrive.

All other conditions remain the same, as indicated in my letter to Academician Keldish.

We look forward to your visit with great interest.

Yours sincerely,
George E. Forsight, dean
