Academic Dictionary for Foundational Informatics
and Computer Science
/for secondary-school textbooks/

    This dictionary contains over 200 terms and phrases 
relevant to the course "Foundations of Informatics and Comp-
uting Techniques" for secondary-level educational institutions.
The dictionary provides the definition of terms, their grammat
-ical characteristics, and identifies the most common uses
of the term in relevant speech. The meaning and uses of terms in 
relevant speech is given by examples from educational, popular-
science literature and periodicals. English versions are given.
    The dictionary includes and Appendix, in which a systematiz-
ation of terms and phrases is provided. 
    The dictionary adresses secondary-school students.

PREFACE

    Accelerating scientific and technological progress through
widespread application of advanced technology - robots and pro-
cessing centers, flexible automated systems, microprocessors, 
and software management devices - sets a challenging and signi-
ficant task for the modern school: to achieve full computer lit-
eracy by the year 2000.
    Successful completion of this task will in a great degree
depend not only on the equipment of computational schools of
various capacities, but as well on the level of development and
implementation of training and reference materials as a coherent
and interconnected union in the course of ``Foundations of In-
formatics and Computer Science.''
    A dictionary of educational terminology - in which terms and
phrases of significance to the foundations of informatics and
computational techniques will acquire the necessary descriptions
needed to master the course - must occupy a significant place in 
this effort. (redo this one)
    This dictionary represents the first version of a learning
dictionary for the course in the foundations of informatics and
computer science.
    The primary purpose of the dictionary - will be a textbook 
of course terminology for foundational informatics and computing 
techniques.
    The goal of the dictionary is to facilitate the acquisition
of baseline terminology and, through it, the conceptual frame-

work of informatics and computer science, the cultivation of the
proper use of terms in coherent speech.
    The dictionary includes only the terms relevant to a course
in foundational informatics and computer science. It consists of
180 terms or phrases. Primarily - terms contained relate 
to the structure and principles of working with computers, and 
the foundations of informatics and programming. In addition to
the terms described above, the dictionary includes terms reflec-
ting concepts from other domains of knowledge - mathematics,
radio-engineering, and other technical fields.
    The dictionary consists of three parts:
    I.   Introduction, including a preface, the rules of dicton-
ary use, lexicographic sources, and a list of literature used in
creating the dictionary.
    II.  Dictionary entries.
    III. Appendix.
    The dictionary entries are arranged in alphabetical order,
which makes it much easier to find the right word. As well,
terminological phrases are listed by head word - in a 
single entry, thus facilitating connections between the general 
and the specific, for better conceptual and terminological und-
erstanding. (take another look at this one)

ALGORITHM, pl. algorithms, n.
    A sequence of commands (instructions) to an executor (human
    or automatic) to achieve a specific task.

    *Algorithm* loops, executes, is used, is applied, creates
...

    *Auxiliary algorithm* - an algorithms whose execution is set
by calling it from another algorithm, called the ``main 
algorithm" in relation to this algorithm;
    *Linear algorithm* - an algorithms without branches or
loops, executed strictly in sequence, in the order commands are
written;
    *Main algorithm* - an algorithm, in which there is a command
calling another, auxiliary algorithm;
    *Recursive algorithm* - an algorithm which, when executed,
calls itself;
    *Algorithm header* - the initial part of the record incl-
uding the name of the algorithm, a list of its arguments and
values, indicating the types of of values;
    *Algorithm step* - a single algorithm execution stage, con-
sisting of the execution of one simple command or condition-
check.

    Many specific algorithms (for example, column addition algo-
rithms) have been known for a very long time, but a generalized
idea of the algorithm was formulated in the first half of the
20th century (Kvant, 1985, no. 9, p. 53). An attempt to use
computers to solve any task begins with an algorithm  (Kvant, 
1985, no. 7, p. 15). When it comes to solving problems with the 
help of a computer, the central concern is the selection of an
algorithm for solving the problem (Kvant, 1986, No. 10, p.47).
Several arguments can be used in auxiliary algorithms (Science 
and Life, 1986, No. 3, p.82).
    *Rus. Алгоритм* The term ``algorithm" is based on the name
of Alb Khorezmi (which means ``of Khorezm") - a great mathemat-
ician of the 9th century.
